# GameMicroService
#### CSCI 4350
#### Hand-crafted: Fall 23, spring 24

### Overview:
This is a microservice that returns game info and game JS in JSON format to the [BucStop](https://github.com/BucStop-net/BucStop.net-Game).

### Project Structure:
* The application handles HTTP calls in the microController.cs file in the /GameMicroServer/Controllers directory. The controller then processes these requests and returns the required resources. 

### Help
